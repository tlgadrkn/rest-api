The `config` package in Node.js is used for organizing and managing configuration settings for your applications. It lets you define a set of default parameters, and extend them for different deployment environments (development, QA, staging, production, etc.).

Key features include:

- Easy configuration of short and long command line options
- Reading and setting of config variables via environment variables
- Supports loading configuration from file systems, environment variables, command-line arguments, and external sources like databases or APIs.

### Healthcheck

```ts
app.get('/healthcheck', (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  res.sendStatus(200);
});
```

The code you've selected sets up a "health check" endpoint for your application. When a GET request is made to the /healthcheck path, the server responds with a status code of 200.

A health check is a simple way to verify that a service or application is up and running. It's commonly used in monitoring and alerting systems to check the status of services and trigger alerts if they're not responding as expected.

In this case, if your application is running and able to handle requests, a GET request to /healthcheck will return a 200 status code, indicating "OK" or "Success". If the application is not running or is unable to handle the request for some reason, a different status code would be returned, indicating an error.

### Middleware

#### validateResource.ts

```ts

```

The validateResource.ts file is responsible for providing a middleware function in a Node.js application. This middleware function uses a schema to validate incoming HTTP requests. The purpose of this validation is to ensure that the data contained in the request matches the expected format and types as defined in the schema. If the request data does not match the schema, the middleware can reject the request or handle it accordingly. This helps to maintain data integrity and prevent processing of invalid or malicious data.

when a request comes in, we're gonna provide a schema in the middleware that will validate the request against the schema

This code is a part of a user registration or update process in a web application. It's a security measure to protect user passwords. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

When a user is created or updated in the database, this function is triggered just before the data is saved (that's what pre('save') means).

### JWT

JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. They are often used for authentication and authorization purposes in web development. Here's an overview of how JWT works:

1. Structure of a JWT:
   A JWT is a string with three parts separated by dots (.): header.payload.signature.
   Header: Contains metadata about the type of token and the signing algorithm used.
   Payload: Contains the claims. Claims are statements about an entity (typically, the user) and additional data.
   Signature: Used to verify that the sender of the JWT is who it says it is and to ensure that the message wasn't changed along the way.
2. Creation of a JWT:
3. User Authentication:
   A user logs in with their credentials, and the server verifies the identity.
4. Token Creation:
   Upon successful authentication, the server generates a JWT containing claims about the user (e.g., user ID, roles).
   The server constructs the header, payload, and calculates the signature using a secret key.
   The three parts are combined into a string, and the JWT is returned to the client.
5. Sending the JWT:
   The client receives the JWT and stores it, typically in a secure manner such as in an HTTP-only cookie or local storage.
6. Verification of JWT:
7. Token Sent with Requests:
   The client includes the JWT in the header of subsequent requests, often in the Authorization header.
8. Server-Side Verification:
   The server receives the JWT and separates the header, payload, and signature.
   The server verifies the signature using the secret key. If the signature is valid, it means the token has not been tampered with.
   The server checks the expiration date and other claims to ensure the token is still valid.
   If the signature is valid and the claims are valid, the server trusts the information in the token.
9. User Authorization:
   The server uses the information in the JWT to make authorization decisions, such as granting access to specific resources based on the user's roles or permissions.
   Important Considerations:
   Secret Key: The secret key used to sign the JWT should be kept secret. It's used to both create and verify the signature.
   Token Expiration: JWTs often include an expiration time to reduce the risk of unauthorized access.
   Use of HTTPS: JWTs should be transmitted over HTTPS to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the token.
   Example:
   Here's a simple example of a JWT:

Copy code
eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiaWF0IjoxNTE2MjM5MDIyfQ.SflKxwRJSMeKKF2QT4fwpMeJf36POk6yJV_adQssw5c
Header: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9
Payload: eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiaWF0IjoxNTE2MjM5MDIyfQ
Signature: SflKxwRJSMeKKF2QT4fwpMeJf36POk6yJV_adQssw5c
The decoded payload might look like:

json
Copy code
{
"sub": "1234567890",
"name": "John Doe",
"iat": 1516239022
}
This payload contains information about the user (subject, name, and issued at time).

In summary, JWTs provide a stateless and secure way of transmitting information between parties, often used in authentication and authorization scenarios in web development. They are widely adopted due to their simplicity, flexibility, and ease of integration with various platforms and technologies.

### Hashing

Hashing is a process used in computing to convert an input (like a password) into a fixed-size string of characters, which typically appears random. The output is known as a hash value or simply hash.

The important thing about a hash value is that it is nearly impossible to derive the original input value from it. This is why it's used for storing passwords: even if the hash value is discovered, it can't be used to find out what the original password was.

In the context of your code, when a user's password is hashed, it's transformed into a hash value. This hash value, rather than the user's actual password, is what's stored in the database. When the user logs in, the password they enter is hashed again, and this hash is compared to the stored hash. If they match, the password is correct. This way, the user's password is never stored in plain text, which is good for security.

### Salting

Salting is a technique used to make hashes more secure. It involves adding random data to the input before hashing it. This makes the hash output unique even for identical input passwords, providing extra security.

#### Salt work factor

The salt work factor is a number that determines how much work is required to generate a salt. The higher the number, the more work is required. This is a security measure to prevent brute-force attacks on the password.

### bcrypt

bcrypt is a library for hashing passwords. It's used to turn your password into a scrambled set of characters, known as a hash. This hash is what's stored in the database, not your actual password.

The special thing about bcrypt is that it adds a 'salt' to the password before hashing it. A salt is a random piece of data generated for each user. This means that even if two users have the same password, their hashes will be different because their salts are different.

When you log in, bcrypt takes the password you enter, adds the salt, hashes the result, and compares it to the stored hash. If they match, the password is correct.

So, bcrypt is used to securely store passwords and check them when you log in, without ever storing your actual password.

### comparePassword

comparePassword is typically a method used in the context of user authentication in a web application. It's used to compare the password provided by the user (for example, during login) with the hashed password stored in the database.

Here's a simplified explanation of how it might work:

The user enters their password into the login form.
This password is sent to the server, where the comparePassword method is called.
The comparePassword method takes the entered password and the stored hashed password as inputs.
It hashes the entered password in the same way as the stored password was hashed when it was first saved (using the same salt and hash function).
It then compares this hash with the stored hash. If they match, the entered password is correct.

### jwt

Sure, here's how I would explain JWT in a senior role interview:

JSON Web Tokens, or JWTs, are a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. The claims are encoded as a JSON object that is used as the payload of a JSON Web Signature (JWS) structure or as the plaintext of a JSON Web Encryption (JWE) structure. This enables the claims to be digitally signed or integrity protected with a Message Authentication Code (MAC) and/or encrypted.

JWTs are often used in authentication and authorization mechanisms. In a typical use case, a client might receive a JWT upon successful authentication with their credentials. This JWT is then included in subsequent requests to the server, which can validate the token and ensure the user is authorized to perform the requested operation.

The key benefits of JWTs are:

Self-contained: They carry all necessary information within themselves, no need to query a database more than once.
Compact: They are small in size, which makes them excellent to be sent via URL, POST parameter, or inside an HTTP header.
Usage across different domains: They work across different domains, so they are excellent for single sign-on (SSO) situations.

### TBD

The function first checks if the password has been changed. If not, it skips the rest of the function and proceeds with saving the user data. This is to avoid unnecessary work when the password hasn't changed.

If the password has been changed (or is new), it generates a "salt". A salt is random data that is used as an additional input to a one-way function that hashes data, a password in this case. This makes the hash output unique even for identical input passwords, providing extra security.

The function then hashes the password. Hashing is a way of encrypting the password so that even if someone gets access to the database, they can't see the actual password. The hashing process uses the password and the salt, and produces a hash, which is a string of characters.

The original password is then replaced with this hash in the user data.

Finally, the function calls next(), which means "I'm done here, you can proceed with saving the data now".

So, in simple terms, this function is a security guard that ensures passwords are securely encrypted before they are stored in the database.

````ts
userSchema.pre('save', async function (next) {
  let user = this as UserDocument;
  //  only hash the password if it has been modified (or is new)
  if (!user.isModified('password')) return next();
  //  Random additional data
  const salt = await bcrypt.genSalt(config.get<number>('saltWorkFactor'));
  const hash = await bcrypt.hashSync(user.password, salt);
  //  Replace the password with the hash
  user.password = hash;
  return next();
});```
